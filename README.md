# YouTube Thumbnail Complexity Data Analysis
### This repo is for Steven, Nico, and Chris to work on YouTube thumbnail complexity analysis for Sandbox.


## Objective
This notebook will analyze thumbnail data using the data science lifecylce. This civic project is a collaboration between Minerva University (Fall 2021, Sophomore, Seoul) and Sandbox Network. Sandbox is a leading multi-channel network (MCN) in South Korea that supports over 450 digital creators and their content.
